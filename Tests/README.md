# Tests

This directory contains all the tests for the embedded application.

## Subdirectories:

- **Unit/**: Contains unit tests for individual modules and components. These tests focus on verifying the correctness of specific functions and classes in isolation.
- **Integration/**: Contains integration tests that verify the interaction between different modules or components of the application.
- **Mocks/**: Contains mock implementations of hardware interfaces, external libraries, or other dependencies. These mocks are used to isolate components during unit and integration testing.

## Running Tests:

[Instructions on how to build and run tests will be added here once the test framework and build system are set up.]
